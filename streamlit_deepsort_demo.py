In typical tracking applications, such as the tracking of cars or pedestrians, the objects being tracked are in view most of the time and are only hidden (occluded) part of the time. It is the opposite with belugas: they are hidden most of the time and only visible (above water) a fraction of the time. In addition, belugas are difficult to distinguish from one another, particularly at a distance.")
